Have you ever needed biblical advice on a subject? Or perhaps had a question to which you didn't know the answer? Then I'll do what I can to give you a
<br>good biblical answer with a good application so that you know just what to
<br>do. Wether you've been wronged and don't know how to respond, or you just have a question I'll get an answer if I don't already have one for you.
